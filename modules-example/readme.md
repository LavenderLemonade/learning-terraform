this is the section for modules

modules represent a layer of abstraction, kind of like functions or classes. 

a useful module takes a group of resources that can be logically grouped together and creates infrastructure that keeps the finicky, under-the-hood bits away from those who dont need them, such as developers, and allows them to work within a framework that gives them room to do their job without needing to mess with configuring their ionfrastructure as well.
